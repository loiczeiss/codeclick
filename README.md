# CookieClicker

## Code Clicker

## Instructions
Her are the instruction we received from our coaches.

### Step 1: base structure

Write the base structure for the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within the HTML, put a click button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at 0 to display said counter.  


### Step 2: prepare the JavaScript

In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.  

  
### Step 3: increase the score

When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.

### Step 4: make a multiplier

Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.

### Step 5: price of multiplier

The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

### Step 6: no credit

You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

### Step 7: display multiplier counter

Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.

### Step 8: increase the cost

Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

### Step 9: display the cost

In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

### Step 10: auto-clicker

Implement a new improvement to buy, the auto-click. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each x seconds.

### Step 11: bonus

Implement yet another improvement to buy, the bonus. It should grant the player a boost in score of 200% per click for 30 seconds. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

### Step 12: deactivate the buttons

Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.

### Step 13: make it pretty

Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.

# Who

Our team is composed or Clément, Loic and Jilani. 

The first was responsible of the Javascript and wrote the better part of it while the other two were on the Html and CSS, altought all have participated in some capacity in the JS. It is wildy accepted that all came out with a better understanding of JS thanks to this exercice. Loïc tryed his best to give the team directions and learned a great deal about what is important to keep in mind while picturing what to do and how to do. He got lucky and worked with two great minds, capable of communicating in a healthy way.

## What

The functions implemented respond to the criteria that were asked by the coaches in their instruction and in their later remarks during the developping process. They constitute the skeleton of an idle game which will be explained later in the concept section.

The website was made responsive thanks to the css grid. The user can go from a two columns display with smaller object to a wider desktop mode.


### The concept

We thought a greal deal about what could be the general idea of a great idle game. Some thoughts were not all safe for work or very bright... But we finally decided to get our inspiration from what is becoming our daily 
routine : coding.

So we created Code Clicker, a game simulating the sweat, blood and tears 
but mostly this feeling of achievement,
this warm embodying sensation that, in a second, you passed from a dumb boy to a god damn genius.

We used programming languages to create incrementors,  emuling the sense of getting faster and faster each time you practice such or such language.
To represent multipliers, we thought of the step of a web developer to be, processing through the ladder will make you earn more at each step and delegate work to the peasants steps behind.

The items icons permits to upgrade the mutlipliers and incrementors because why the hell not? Just an other way of expressing that you gain in speed and improve your skills through hard-working practice of coding.

P.S.: We got a little Dante saying stuffs at some points, cool innit?


### Pending things to do

- More pop-ups from lil' Dante;
- Tighter display of every elements;
- Shrink long functions into more concises ones (but we did work on that aspect, even shed tears...);
- Better responsive display;
- Longer lasting game by increasing the upgrades numbers;
- Why not throwing in an auto-save or just any save at all...
